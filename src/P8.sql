Creating a composite index on `(department, salary)` significantly enhances the performance of the query by allowing the database to efficiently locate and filter rows based on both conditions specified in the `WHERE` clause. This index helps avoid a full table scan by quickly narrowing down to rows where `department = 'Sales'` and then filtering by `salary > 50000`. However, this improvement comes with trade-offs, including increased storage space for the index and added overhead for write operations, such as insertions and updates, as the index needs to be maintained.
